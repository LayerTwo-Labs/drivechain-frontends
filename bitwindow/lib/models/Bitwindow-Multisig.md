## Advanced Features

### Group Import/Export

#### Import Multisig Group via TXID
Use this to restore or join an existing multisig group:

1. Click **"Import from TXID"** in Group Tools
2. **Import Modal** opens - enter the transaction ID containing multisig data
3. Click **"Fetch Multisig Data"** to query blockchain
4. System extracts OP_RETURN data and validates:
   - Multisig flag presence (0x02)
   - Encryption status (encrypted groups cannot be imported)
   - JSON structure with group configuration
5. **Automatic Wallet Detection**:
   - System checks if any group keys belong to your wallet
   - Keys with matching derivation paths are flagged as "Wallet Key"
   - External keys are flagged as "External Key"
6. Review detected keys and group information
7. Click **"Import Group"** to save locally
8. System creates watch-only wallet with descriptors for monitoring

#### Export Group Information
Share group details with other participants:
- Group configuration saved in `bitdrive/multisig/multisig.json`
- Contains all public keys and descriptors
- Can be shared for group reconstruction

### PSBT File Management

#### Export PSBTs
Each transaction stores multiple PSBT states:
- **Initial PSBT**: Unsigned template
- **Participant PSBTs**: Individual signed versions
- **Combined PSBT**: Final merged version

#### Import External PSBTs
Support for PSBT files from:
- Hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor, etc.)
- Software wallets (Electrum, Specter, etc.)
- Other Bitwindow instances

### Wallet Integration

#### HD Wallet Detection
- **Automatic Key Recognition**: When loading multisig groups, system automatically checks if any keys belong to your wallet
- **Derivation Path Matching**: Validates keys against your seed phrase using exact derivation paths
- **Wallet Flag Updates**: Sets `isWallet: true` for owned keys, enabling automatic signing
- **Account Index Range**: Searches account indices 8000-8099 for wallet-generated keys

#### Key Restoration Process
1. **Initial Validation**: `_validateAndFixWalletFlags()` runs at startup
2. **Key Matching**: For each group key, system attempts derivation using stored path
3. **XPub Comparison**: Generated xpub compared with group key's xpub
4. **Flag Updates**: Matching keys get updated with wallet metadata
5. **Transaction History**: Wallet groups automatically restore transaction history
6. **Balance Sync**: Group balances update from Bitcoin Core wallet data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "No wallet keys found in group"
- **Cause**: Your seed phrase doesn't match any keys in the multisig
- **Solution**: Verify you're using the correct wallet or import the group correctly

#### "Transaction signing failed"
- **Cause**: Wallet not initialized or incorrect derivation path
- **Solution**: Ensure wallet is unlocked and keys match group configuration

#### "PSBT validation failed"
- **Cause**: Corrupted or incompatible PSBT file
- **Solution**: Re-export the PSBT or use a different signing method

#### "Insufficient balance"
- **Cause**: Trying to spend more than available or fees too high
- **Solution**: Check group balance and reduce amount or fees

#### "Group creation failed"
- **Cause**: Invalid parameters or duplicate keys
- **Solution**: Verify M â‰¤ N and all keys are unique

### File Locations
- **Multisig Groups**: `bitdrive/multisig/multisig.json`
- **Transactions**: `bitdrive/transactions.json`
- **Bitcoin Core Wallets**: Bitcoin data directory

### Recovery Options

#### Reset Wallet State
If groups or transactions become corrupted:
1. Backup your data files
2. Delete problematic JSON files
3. Restart Bitwindow
4. Re-import groups via TXID if needed

#### Emergency Recovery
- Keep backup copies of group configurations
- Save initial PSBTs for incomplete transactions
- Document all TXIDs for group reconstruction

## Security Best Practices

### Key Management
1. **Never share private keys**: Only share xpubs and derivation paths
2. **Verify public keys**: Confirm keys through multiple channels
3. **Use hardware wallets**: For high-value multisig groups
4. **Backup everything**: Group configs, PSBTs, and seed phrases

### Transaction Security
1. **Verify amounts**: Double-check transaction details before signing
2. **Validate addresses**: Confirm destination addresses independently
3. **Check fees**: Ensure reasonable fee rates
4. **Monitor confirmations**: Wait for adequate confirmations

### Operational Security
1. **Secure communications**: Use encrypted channels for coordination
2. **Role separation**: Different people for different keys
3. **Regular testing**: Test with small amounts first
4. **Update software**: Keep Bitwindow and Bitcoin Core updated

### Backup Strategy
1. **Seed phrases**: Secure offline storage for all participants
2. **Group configurations**: Multiple copies of multisig.json
3. **PSBT archive**: Save important transaction PSBTs
4. **Documentation**: Record group details and participant contacts
